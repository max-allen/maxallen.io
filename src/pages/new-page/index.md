Occasionally I've encountered questions like, *"How can I start learning React,"* *"What are React's prerequisites,"*
or *"What should I know in advance so I can learn React efficiently?"* This article aims to answer these questions. It

```javascript
const functionalComponent = () => {
	return (
		<div>
			{this.state.user}
		</div>
	)
}
```
